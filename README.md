## PearlPlus

PearlPlus automatically detects new stasis pearls and registers them with its own pearl loader. Pearl throwers can then load these pearls through chat whispers.
The config is saved to `plugins/config/pearlplus.json`

In Zenith run `plugins download https://github.com/duccss/PearlPlus/releases/download/2.1.0/PearlPlus-2.1.0.jar` or download the [lastest build](https://github.com/duccss/PearlPlus/releases/latest) and place the jar file in your proxy's plugin folder.

This plugin **WILL NOT WORK** unless a correct `chatschema` is set in Zenith. Most vanilla servers like 2b2t and Constantiam don't require you to set one but other servers with custom whisper builders for example 9b9t will need one. Please check the wiki [here](https://wiki.2b2t.vc/Commands/#chatschema).
You might also need to set the whisper command for the server you're playing on using `extraChat whisperCommand <command>` to allow the bot to whisper back.

If you're chat banned/muted you can load pearls in your client using [PearlPlusMod](https://github.com/duccss/PearlPlusMod) and [PearlPlusWebAPI](https://github.com/duccss/PearlPlusWebAPI) which bypass's chat.

### Management Commands

#### You can use either `pp` or `pearlplus`

```bash
pearlplus <on/off>
```
```bash
pearlplus add <playerName> <pearlId> <x> <y> <z>
```
```bash
pearlplus del <playerName> <pearlId>
```
```bash
pearlplus list
```
```bash
pearlplus list clear
```
```bash
pearlplus defaultpearlid <word/none>
```
```bash
pearlplus autodefault <on/off>
```
```bash
pearlplus strict <on/off>
```
```bash
pearlplus loadcommand <word>
```
```bash
pearlplus autodetect <on/off>
```
```bash
pearlplus autodetect temp <on/off>
```
```bash
pearlplus returnpos <on/off>
```
```bash
pearlplus distancecheck <on/off>
```

```bash
pearlplus whitelist <on/off>
pearlplus whitelist add <playername>
pearlplus whitelist del <playername>
pearlplus whitelist list
pearlplus whitelist clear
```

```bash
pearlplus droppearlafterload <on/off>
```

```bash
pearlplus set-restock-container <x> <y> <z>
pearlplus set-restock-container clear
```

After a successful load, if the bot has no ender pearls left, it walks to the configured container (chest, barrel, shulker, etc.) and takes one stack.

```bash
pearlplus debug <true/false>
```

When debug is on, the terminal prints the trapdoor (and nearby candidates) the bot is about to click.

### In-game Whisper Commands

There are a few in-game commands players can whisper to the bot to manage their pearls.

`pearls` will list all pearlID's with an asterisk next to ID's where a pearl isn't detected.

`rename oldPearlID newPearlID` changes the pearlID.

`default PearlID` sets that pearl as default if `autodefault` disabled.

### Usage

Simply throw a new ender pearl and once it becomes stable the bot will register it, setting the pearlID as "Base" by default with an incrementing number for subsequent pearls. That player can now whisper `load` (or your configured load command) to the zenith bot and the bot will load the pearl. Players with multiple pearls can add the pearlID after the trigger word to have a specific pearl loaded. Players will receive a warning whisper when loading a stasis chamber where a pearl isn't detected.
```bash
/w <botName> load <optionalID> 
```
By default, when a player doesn't specify which pearl they want loaded the bot will load whatever one where a pearl is detected. Can be disabled with `pp autodefault off`

Temp mode automatically removes pearl positions where a pearl isn't detected. May be buggy. Not recommended. Do **NOT** use `pp distancecheck` with temp mode.

Can be enabled with `pp autodetect temp on` 

#### Manual setup
Use the `pp add/del` commands to set up manually.

#### 2b2t / Anti-spam

By default, the bot resolves the username of pearl throwers with entity ID's. Some servers might not allow this so if the bot is unable to register pearls automatically use `pp distancecheck on`. This will get the throwers name from the closest player to the pearl. 2b2t players have reported autodetect ceasing to work occasionally. Always test before enabling this feature.

By default, you can add a random word after `load` or the `pearlID` to get around anti-spam. This can be disabled using `pp strict on`.

#### Recommended Zenith settings

`antiAFK walk off`

`b allowBreak off`

`b allowPlace off`

These settings will stop your pearl bot walking off and prevent it breaking/placing blocks as baritone paths to the pearl trapdoor.
